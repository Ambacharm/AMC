                    Talk shows are an important feature of the US media landscape. They have established themselves as a 
                    legitimate source of information. Talk shows are not easily categorised because even the ones that 
                    position themselves primarily as comedy (late-night comedy shows) are also important forums of political discourse. 
                    Politically oriented talk shows are also dominated by prime time political analysis programming. <br> <br>
            
            Political analysis programming has a clear partisan orientation and is not primarily designed as entertainment. 
            They comment on news and current events in a very scripted way. We find these shows on both sides of the political 
            spectrum with progressives being represented mostly on CNN and MSNBC and conservatives predominantly on Fox News. <br> <br>
            
            What is meant by conservative talk shows is 'outrage programming'. These shows seek to arouse outrage and anger 
            in the audience by using inflammatory language to point at enemies and threats (Democrats, progressives, etc.). 
            Outrage aims to reinforce viewers' preexisting opinions. <br> <br>
            
            Late-night comedy shows are also very scripted but their hosts are entertainers, not commentators. They use humour and satire to cover events and articulate their critique. Paradoxically, because they are not bound by traditional norms of journalism they conduct much more thorough analysis on important issues and their viewers are usually more knowledgeable about the issues. Late-night comedy also produces a "gateway effect": exposure to these shows increases interest in the news and leads viewers to seek supplementary information from traditional outlets.
