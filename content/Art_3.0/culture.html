                  <p class="card-text">The NYC Museum of Modern Art, situated in Middle Manhattan, opened in 1929 at the instigation of two ladies, Mrs Abby Aldrich Rockefeller and Mary Quinn Sullivan.
                    It was the first museum dedicated to modern art in the USA back then. Little by little, the Moma gained international prominence by organising successful exhibitions of artists like Picasso,
                    Edward Hopper, Whistler, Rothko, Walker Evans or Native American artists. <br>
                    It has now a very rich permanent collection of more than 200,000 works of modern and contemporary art. The American painter Jackson Pollock, a major figure of the abstract expressionist movement, 
                    features highly in this collection thanks to the donation of major works made by Pollock's wife after his death.

                  <h5 class="card-title">video games industry: <br> indies vs AAA (triple A) games</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">An "indie" is a video game created by a small, independent development team contrary to AAA games which are developed by mid-sized or major game publishers
                    such as Electronic Arts or Ubisoft. Company size obviously makes a huge difference to the development and marketing budgets. <br>
                    The succession of the generations of video game consoles (Play Station, Wii, Xbox) led to an increase in costs and staffing. <br>
                    The video game industry is now considered a very lucrative one: in 2019, the gaming market value amounted to $145 billion and it is expected to reach $200 billion by 2023.
                    This is more than double the revenue of the international film industry. <br> In 2020, some studios started using the term AAAA (quadruple A) to describe their upcoming games adapted to a new level of technology.

                  <h5 class="card-title">Immersive art</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">Immersive art consists in putting the spectator inside a world which is often illusory, a world that is artificially created thanks to augmented reality and computer-generated images. It may also,
                    more simply, refer to an exhibition including interactive elements. <br> The artists use immersive virtual reality art to allow the spectator to visit the artwork and be part of it, making it an interactive experience.
                    Interactive installations appeared in the late 1980s. <i>Legible City</i> by the leading figure of the new media art, Jeffrey Shaw, is considered a pioneering immersive installation.

                  <h5 class="card-title">David Hockney</h5>

                  <p class="card-text">David Hockney (born in 1937) is a British painter, but also printmaker, stage designer and photographer. He was part of the pop art movement of the 1960s
                    and is now considered a hugely influential artist worldwide. <br>
                    In 1963, he moved to California where he painted his famous sensual scenes of athletic men in swimming pools, thus tackling the subject of homosexual loive.
                    After coming back to England for a while, he has recently settled in Normandy. <br>
                    He has experimented with several techniques, such as painting, prints, drawings, photogrpahy, photocollages with polaroid pictures and even cutting-edge technology with fax machines
                    or iPads. In 2018, one of his most famous paintings, <i>Portrait of the Artist (Pool with two Figures)</i>, sold for $90 million at Christie's auction house in NYC.
